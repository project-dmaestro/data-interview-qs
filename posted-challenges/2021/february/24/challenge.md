# Alternative array sorting

[solution in R](solution-r.md) <br>
[solution in Python](solution-python.md)

Given an array of integers, print the array in alternating min/max order. The first element should be the first maximum, second element should be the first minimum, third element should be second maximum, etc.

For example:

```Python
# Given the following array:
arr[] = [10, 2, 11, 3, 7, 4, 1]

# Your function should return:
11, 1, 10, 2, 7, 3, 4
```
