Suppose Candy Company XYZ produces lollipops. The company claims that 30% of the lollipops are cherry, 60% are grape, and 10% are lime.

Given a random sampling of 100 lollipops with 50 cherry, 45 grape, and 5 lime, determine whether or not this is consistent with the company's claim. Use a 0.05 level of significance.
