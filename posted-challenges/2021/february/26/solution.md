<p align = "justify> Naive Bayes' Theorem is a classification technique based on Bayes' Theorem <b> under the assumption </b> that each explanatory variable is independent of each other. One reason why it's not used in algorithms is the mere fact that each predictor <i> has to be independent </i> of each other which is almost impossible to find in real world problems. </p>

<p align = justify> Another concern arises when encountering an unknown category in the test dataset's categorical variable because it didn't exist in the train dataset. The model is going to fail in making a prediction and assign zero probability instead. This phenomenon is known as <b> Zero Frequency </b>. In the real world, finding a new category that hadn't existed in the first place isn't an uncommon occurence. </p>
