# World leader exits

[solution in R](solution-r.md) <br>
[solution in Python](solution-python.md)

Suppose you have the following [dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c-ggjDyeZ_ByKOe5J8mKkZViDo_FW8EYvzkCRQc-Ds0/edit#gid=1561619208), which is a list of leaders for all independent states in the world as outlined in Gleditsch and Ward.

With this data, plot the number of leaders by their exit code ('exitcode' in data) and the year that their rule ended ('endyear' in the data). You can represent this in a stacked bar chart, with the x-axis showing the end year and the y-axis showing the count of leaders by exitcode represented as a stacked bar chart.
