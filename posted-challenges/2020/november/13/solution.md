# solution

![](images/binomial.png)

I defined a few things from the given information:

- The number of trials ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\inline&space;n) is 20. That would be the number of gaskets in a box.
- The probability of success defined as when a gasket would be defective, ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\inline&space;p) is ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\inline&space;0.01).
- The probability of failure defined as when a gasket would be functional, ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\inline&space;q&space;=&space;1&space;-&space;0.0.1) which is ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\inline&space;0.99).
- The desired success defined as finding two or more defective gaskets in a box, ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\inline&space;P(x\geq2)&space;=&space;1&space;-&space;P(x&space;<&space;2)).

Plugged in the numbers and I'd get:

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?P(x&space;\geq&space;2)&space;=&space;1&space;-&space;P(x&space;<&space;2)) <br>
![]()

That'd meant about 1.68%
